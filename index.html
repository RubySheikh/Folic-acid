            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <p>Folic acid is a form of folate, a B vitamin which helps body to make healthy new cells. All women's who are capable of becoming pregnant should get 400 mcg of folic acid every day. Getting 400 micrograms of folic acid daily can help prevent serious type of birth defects called neural tube defects.

            <h3>Significance</h3><br>
            <p>Folate is a B-vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. Your body needs folate to make DNA and other genetic material. Your body also needs folate for your cells to divide. A form of folate, called folic acid, is used in fortified foods and most dietary supplements.</p>

            <h3> What is the role of folic acid in preventing birth defects?
</h3>
<p>A critical period of fetal development happens during the early weeks of pregnancy, often before a woman is aware she is even pregnant.</p>

<p>One of the earliest structures to form is the neural tube. This structure is flat at first, but rolls into a tube by only 1 month after conception to become the brain and spinal cord.</p>

<p>Without enough folic acid, the cells in this structure can’t function or grow properly and the tube doesn’t close. The spine, skull, and brain can be affected, with open or closed abnormalities.</p>


<p>Two of the most common types of NTDs are spina bifida and anencephaly. Spina bifida is a condition in which a portion of the spinal cord and the surrounding structures develops outside, instead of inside the body. Anencephaly is a condition in which the brain and skull bones do not form properly and results in parts of the brain being absent.</p>
